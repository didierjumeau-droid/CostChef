Doc: CostChef – Product Specification (v3.0 – CURRENT STATE) 

costchefspec_updated

a) Section 3 – Key Features (CURRENTLY IMPLEMENTED)

Right now this section stops at:

Recipe Versioning ✅

Duplicate Recipe Name Prevention ✅

👉 Add a new item 8 right after that:

8. Recipe Profitability Dashboard ✅
• Dedicated dashboard to analyze recipe‐level profitability.
• For each recipe: cost per serving, selling price, gross profit per serving, margin %, and food cost %.
• Color-coded profitability (green/yellow/red) to highlight high- and low-performing items.
• Sorting and filtering by category and margin %.
• Uses existing recipe costing and selling price fields; no extra data entry required. 

implementation of inventory

b) Section 6 – UI/UX (ACTUAL WINDOWS FORMS) ✅

You already list all inventory forms individually, but RecipeProfitabilityForm is missing.

After the block:

InventoryReportsForm.cs – Inventory valuation, low stock, high value, monthly comparison, snapshots
InventoryHistoryForm.cs – View and filter inventory movements per ingredient
InventoryAdjustForm.cs – Quick IN/OUT stock adjustments with reason
InventoryEditForm.cs – Edit detailed stock and thresholds for a single ingredient
InventoryForm.cs – Main inventory view (stock list, summary, quick actions)
SupplierReportsForm.cs – Supplier analytics

👉 Insert this line:

RecipeProfitabilityForm.cs – Recipe profitability dashboard (margin %, food cost %, ranking, color-coded performance). 

implementation of inventory

Then keep the rest as-is:

SettingsForm.cs – Application settings
SplashScreenForm.cs – Startup screen
ImportExportForm.cs – Data import/export
PriceHistoryForm.cs – IMPLEMENTED – Price history tracking
RecipeVersionHistoryForm.cs – IMPLEMENTED – Recipe versioning and comparison

c) Section 11 – Roadmap (UPDATED) 🚀

Currently you have:

Next Features (V3.1+):
• Menu profitability dashboard – Visual analytics and menu engineering
• Actual vs Theoretical (AvT) Lite
• Allergen tracking
• Advanced reporting

But per Current State Assessment, the Recipe Profitability Dashboard is already implemented in v3.0. 

implementation of inventory

So I’d tweak Roadmap to make that clear and push “menu engineering” into the next level:

Replace that block with:

Next Features (V3.1+):
• Menu engineering & advanced profit analytics – build on the existing Recipe Profitability Dashboard with more visual grids, category views, and engineering matrix (Stars / Plowhorses / etc.).
• Actual vs Theoretical (AvT) Lite – variance analysis using inventory_history and recipe usage.
• Allergen tracking – ingredient allergen flags and recipe-level aggregation.
• Advanced reporting – PDF exports and bundled multi-report outputs.

No DB change implied; we’re just clarifying that v3.0 has the basic profitability dashboard already and v3.1+ is “pro” analytics.

2. Architecture Document – CostChef_Architecture_Updated.docx

Doc: CostChef – Document d’Architecture Logicielle

Here the Inventory module has a full 4.4 section, but there is no dedicated subsection for the profitability dashboard, even though the current state doc lists RecipeProfitabilityForm.cs and new profitability models. 

implementation of inventory

a) New Section 4.5 – Dashboard de rentabilité des recettes

Insert after 4.4 Inventaire and before Fournisseurs (current numbering may shift 4.5 → 4.6, etc.):

4.5 Rentabilité des recettes (Recipe Profitability Dashboard)

UI :
• RecipeProfitabilityForm.cs
– Tableau synthétique des recettes avec colonnes : nom, catégorie, coût par portion, prix de vente, coût matière %, marge %, profit par portion.
– Classement et filtrage par catégorie et par marge %.
– Color-coding : lignes vertes / jaunes / rouges selon la rentabilité (marge % et coût matière %).
– Actions : double-clic pour ouvrir la recette dans RecipesForm pour édition.

Données / logique :
• Repose sur DatabaseContext.Recipes.cs pour récupérer :
– Coût par portion (déjà calculé via le module Recettes).
– Prix de vente (sales_price) et autres champs de performance. 

implementation of inventory


• Calculs clés dans la Form :
– Profit brut par portion = sales_price − cost_per_serving.
– Coût matière % = cost_per_serving / sales_price × 100.
– Marge % = profit_brut / sales_price × 100.
• Aucune nouvelle table : tout est calculé à partir des recettes et des coûts d’ingrédients existants.

Then renumber the following sections (Fournisseurs becomes 4.6, etc.).

b) Section 6 – Complexité & volumétrie du code

If you mention “les plus gros fichiers UI” (SettingsForm, IngredientEditForm, InventoryReportsForm, SupplierReportsForm, RecipeProfitabilityForm is not listed), you can optionally add it to the list:

Add a bullet:

• RecipeProfitabilityForm.cs : dashboard de rentabilité, logique d’affichage et de color-coding, taille intermédiaire mais à surveiller si de nouvelles règles métier sont ajoutées.

(Not mandatory, but nice for completeness.)

3. Competitive Analysis – Competitive_Analysis_Updated.docx

Doc: Competitive Analysis Report – CostChef vs Market

a) “What We Have (V3.0) – Complete Restaurant Management”

Currently this list ends with:

✅ Yield management
✅ Profit tracking
✅ Windows desktop
✅ Inventory Management (one row per ingredient, stock tracking, valuation, snapshots…)

👉 Add a bullet to reflect the current dashboard:

✅ Recipe profitability dashboard (per-recipe profit margin, food cost %, and ranking, with color-coded performance). 

implementation of inventory

b) “High Impact – Implemented / Roadmap”

You currently have:

HIGH IMPACT – IMPLEMENTED

✅ Inventory Management System – V3.0 COMPLETE

Menu Engineering Dashboard – Next priority

Update that to separate implemented vs next:

HIGH IMPACT – IMPLEMENTED

✅ Inventory Management System – V3.0 COMPLETE

✅ Recipe Profitability Dashboard – V3.0 COMPLETE

HIGH IMPACT – NEXT (V3.1+)
• Menu engineering & advanced dashboards (grid, matrix, deeper analytics built on top of the existing profitability dashboard). 

implementation of inventory

c) Roadmap Section

There’s a “V3.1 Next: Menu Profitability Dashboard” block.

Change to:

V3.1 Next: Menu Engineering & Advanced Analytics
• Extend the existing profitability dashboard with full menu engineering (Stars, Plowhorses, Puzzles, Dogs).
• Add richer visual dashboards and export options.

This keeps the marketing story coherent: v3.0 already has the core profitability dashboard; v3.1+ brings the “pro” menu engineering layer.

4. README – README_CostChef_v3.0.md

Doc: top-level README in repo

a) “Key Features (v3.0)” list

Under Key Features you have Ingredients, Recipes, Suppliers, Price History, Recipe Versioning, Inventory Management – no profitability dashboard.

Add a new bullet after “Inventory Management (NEW in v3.0)”:

Recipe Profitability Dashboard

Dedicated form (RecipeProfitabilityForm) to rank recipes by profit margin and food cost %.

Shows cost per serving, selling price, gross profit and margin %.

Color-coded rows to highlight very profitable vs weak items. 

implementation of inventory

b) Roadmap (v3.1+)

Currently:

Menu profitability dashboard (menu engineering)

Actual vs Theoretical (AvT) Lite

Allergen tracking

Advanced reporting

Update to:

Menu engineering & advanced profitability analytics (built on top of the existing Recipe Profitability Dashboard)

Actual vs Theoretical (AvT) Lite using recipes and inventory_history

Allergen tracking (ingredient-level flags, recipe aggregation)

Advanced reporting (PDF export, bundled reports)

5. Continuation Guide – COMPREHENSIVE_CONTINUATION_GUIDE_Updated.docx

This guide is mainly for “how to continue dev in future chats”. It still lists:

Next Priority Features:
– Menu profitability dashboard – Visual analytics and menu engineering
– AvT Lite
– Allergen tracking
– Advanced reporting

But Current State Assessment now says RecipeProfitabilityForm and “Recipe Profitability Dashboard – FULLY IMPLEMENTED”. 

implementation of inventory

So I’d make a small adjustment so this guide is future-proof:

Change the “Next Priority Features” block to:

Next Priority Features:
• Refine menu analytics on top of the existing Recipe Profitability Dashboard (menu engineering, richer filters/visualizations).
• Actual vs Theoretical (AvT) Lite – inventory-based variance.
• Allergen tracking – ingredient allergen information.
• Advanced reporting – PDF export capabilities.

And at the very bottom where it says:

Next Session Starting Point: "Let's implement menu profitability dashboard for visual analytics."

Change to:

Next Session Starting Point: "Let's refine the menu profitability analytics (menu engineering) and/or start AvT Lite."

6. “Menu_Profitability_Dashboard_Spec.docx”

This one is already clearly marked as a draft functional spec for a more advanced dashboard (MenuProfitabilityForm.cs). 

Menu_Profitability_Dashboard_Sp…

You don’t need to change it yet. I’d just keep in mind:

Current implementation = RecipeProfitabilityForm (simple profitability dashboard, already live). 

implementation of inventory

Draft spec = MenuProfitabilityForm (richer filters, variance vs target, etc.) for v3.1.

Later, when you send me the “infos” for the last feature, we’ll either:

align the implementation to this draft spec, or

update the spec to match what’s actually implemented.

TL;DR

Yes, the architecture files and analysis look fine.

The only real gap was that some specs still treated the Recipe Profitability Dashboard as “future”.

With the edits above, all your docs (spec, architecture, competitive analysis, README, continuation guide) will be consistent with v3.0 = Inventory + Recipe Profitability Dashboard fully implemented, stable, and v3.1+ = menu engineering / AvT / allergens / advanced reporting.

Whenever you’re ready, send the detailed info for the “last feature” and we’ll bolt it cleanly onto this updated spec set.
